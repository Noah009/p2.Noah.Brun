# Project 2 Mirror Design

The design of the Mirror is minimalist as to reflect current trends of reducing icons and symbols to their geometric shapes which improves the immediancy of button functionalities and their purpose. The Mirror is to act similar as a smartphone where apps can be dragged and clicked to bring up information for the user.

A Mirror reflects any person or object and to simulate relfection the text editor, processing, will be used to still show either the object or person standing in front of the mirror. Furthermore, the display of information may cause contrast problems, so the mirror will "fog" up by using the tint() while still showing a "reflection" in processing.
<br> </br>
The Sketch is simplistic, reducing icons to basic geometric shapes so the user can see and immediately understand it's purpose. Some General information includes a calender, emails, weather, health, and a clock. Whenever a user clicks on one of the buttons, excluding the clock, a window will pop up displaying the information with the mirror being tinted to help the contrast between text and background.

# Mirror Implementation
Note: The mirror is soley focused on the design aspect rather than pratical application, as such dates, weather, health, etc. should not be taken as accurate information.
