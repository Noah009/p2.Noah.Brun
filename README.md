# Project 2 Mirror Design

The design of the Mirror is minimalist as to reflect current trends of reducing icons and symbols to their geometric shapes which improves the immediancy of button functionalities and their purpose. The Mirror is to act similar as a smartphone where apps can be dragged and clicked to bring up information for the user.

A Mirror reflects any person or object and to simulate relfection the text editor, processing, will be used to still show either the object or person standing in front of the mirror. Furthermore, the display of information may cause contrast problems, so the mirror will "fog" up by using the tint() while still showing a "reflection" in processing.
<br> </br>
The Sketch is simplistic, reducing icons to basic geometric shapes so the user can see and immediately understand it's purpose. Some General information includes a calender, emails, weather, health, and a clock. Whenever a user clicks on one of the buttons, excluding the clock, a window will pop up displaying the information with the mirror being tinted to help the contrast between text and background.

# Mirror Implementation
Note: The mirror is soley focused on the design aspect rather than pratical application, as such dates, weather, health, etc. should not be taken as accurate information.

An advance feature of the Mirror is the ability to drag & drop the buttons anywhere in the mirror, similar to that of apps on a smartphone however, there is no grid layout for buttons to snap on as the ability. The buttons are consistent in design as having round edges with simple two colors, the background and the icon, similarly the information layout are the same color of the button pressed.
<br> </br>
The tinting of the mirror to make it "fog" helps the contrast of text and mirror, allowing for more readability at the cost of seeing the reflection. The information displayed is in Arial type as it is easier to read on screen and there is enough space to prevent visual clutter for both text and buttons.
<br> </br>
Usability for the user is important which is why whenever a user hovers over a button or clicks a white outline appears providing feedback to the user; while not being highlighted like an elevator, it will alleviate confusion between the "fog" and the feedback.
