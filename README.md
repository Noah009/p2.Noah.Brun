# Project 2 Mirror Design

The design of the Mirror is minimalist as to reflect current trends of reducing icons and symbols to their geometric shapes which improves the immediancy of button functionalities and their purpose. The Mirror is to act similar as a smartphone where apps can be dragged and clicked to bring up information for the user.
